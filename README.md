Nasal Namespace Browser
=======================

Reimplementation of the [Nasal Browser](https://wiki.flightgear.org/Nasal_Browser) using Canvas Widgets.
This addon is inspired by the original implementation, which appears to have been lost after the shutdown of Gitorious — I was able to locate what seems to be an old copy, now placed in `/nasal/Legacy/NasalBrowser.nas`.

While it retains the spirit and functionality of the original browser, the codebase has been refactored to use the current FlightGear Canvas UI.

## Keys

- `Up`/`Down` – scroll content with small increments.
- `PageUp`/`PageDown` – scroll the content by one visible screen.
- `Esc` – close the window.
